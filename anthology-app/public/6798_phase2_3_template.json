      "speaker_text": "Thank you. All right, so conversation agreements. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, not your opinions. Allow others to speak for themselves, share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. You guys are really good at that. So I'm not worried. Stay curious. Ask honest questions. Pause and take time for reflection. Don't feel like you have to jump to answer a question. It's okay to sit and think about it. It's okay to chew on it for a little bit. It's okay to miss a question if it. If you're really trying to either figure out what your answer is or you're just not sure in that moment, that's perfectly okay. We want you to really bring to this something authentic and genuine and don't feel forced to go through this process with us. Okay, Listen, generously assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. So keeping with authenticity and being genuine. Also keep in mind the folks in your community and just being mindful of other people's feelings. What you say might have an impact. Does that mean you shouldn't say it? Not necessarily. But if you know that it might hit someone a certain way, just try your best to kind of work through that response. But still, of course, stay genuine and authentic to how you feel. And is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you would like to add or change? A thumbs up reaction will be great. If not, we'll keep it. There's no objection. If there's no objection, from here on out, I'm just going to keep it moving. Okay, so we'll wait for the objection. Will not. Anyways, I'm going to kick us off with a quick round of introductions. Please just please share your first name or a pseudonym. If you don't want to use your first name. You can give a nickname. You can give an abbreviation in addition to your first name. Please share a story about your journey to Boston in the Greater Boston area. What brought you or your family here? Whether that was recently or long ago, and what has your experience been like? I'd love to do popcorn style. If it comes to you and your name is called and you're not ready, feel free to say pass. Okay. And we'll keep it moving. I'll kick us off. All right. So my family, my dad's side of the family grew up in Boston and in. In Lexington as well, but mostly the Boston Roxbury area. And my mother actually is from California, so her and her mother traveled here, I think from California, but they also bounced around to Chicago and Detroit as well because they were struggling with not being housed. So they landed in Boston, and my mother was working at a bakery. She met my dad. Here we are. In my experience in Boston, I was actually born in Washington, D.C. my family left and came back. So my experience has been decent. There's been some bumps along the road because, you know, growing up in Dorchester, Roxbury is not super great, but it's not horrible. There's definitely some nice spots, and I've had some great memories growing up in Dorchester and Roxbury. But there's definitely been some challenges, especially community violence. There's a lot of poverty. There's a lot of substance abuse. There's a lot of people struggling with substance abuse. But there's also. As I've gotten older and stayed in this area, there's a lot of resources popping up. So I'm going to pop it to Nina.",

And then on my dad's side, they came from the Dominican Republic to Boston looking for a job. And then my dad somehow ended up in Chelsea. I don't know how they got from Boston to Chelsea, but here we are. And I love. I love Chelsea a lot. It's just, you know, it's where I grew up. I have a lot of pride. A lot of people in Chelsea have a lot of pride for it. But, like, similar to, like, what you were saying, there was a lot of, like, poverty, substance abuse, and, like, community violence that I would like to change, but it doesn't change the love that I have for my city, and I'd like to pass it off to Christelle.",

And then we came here because my uncle was living here, and then he wanted us to be next to him, so we came here. We lived in Mattapan. I. I don't like Mattapan. Like, I swear Mattapan is the worst part in Boston. Like, it's just. It's a mess. I hate driving to Mattapan. I do my best to avoid it, but we lived in Mattapan, I would say, for about three, four years. And then we moved to Jamaica Plain. I love Jamaica Plain. I wish I could live there, but it's so expensive. And now we moved to Randolph, but I moved out of my home, so I actually live in Dorchester. My experience in Boston, I think same thing with Nina and Sarah, is just there's a lot of violence here. And I really think gentrification, it plays a big part in it. And it really. It's about where you live. Where I live right now, it's a very odd spot because my street, I wouldn't really deem it as ghetto or the bad part, but then the street next to my street is very bad. Like, I try my best not to park my car there because it's just very bad. It's my first time technically living in Dorchester, so I've been living where I am now for two years. But my goal is to move to Quincy. I love Quincy. And I will pass it on to Gabby.",

Besides, like, maybe like, two streets over, kind of like Crystal said, is not like, the best area. There's a lot of violence there. But overall, my experience has been really good in Boston.",

I came here from. I was living in New York City at the time. I'm originally from New Jersey, and I came here for a job, and I am really loving it. I was hesitant at first. I didn't think that I would like Boston, but it has really grown on me. And every time I think about moving or leaving the city, I always, like, find reasons to say, and it always hooks me back in. And so, yeah, so far it's been a good experience, but it's definitely been a transplanter's experience, so I always just keep that in mind. Back to you, Sarah.",

All right, in the rest of this conversation, we want to learn about your experience living in the city, which we did touch on in some of our initial introductory responses. Could you describe a specific time when you felt really supported by your community in Boston? I'd love to hear about who was there and what made that moment special or meaningful. And if you can, if you don't remember specifically in Boston, it's okay to talk about your community, your own community, where you are now as well.",

I'm living by myself. I. I just had a lot of anxiety. But the first big snowstorm happened. It was a really big one. It, like, shut everything down, and I was still new, and I just appreciated, like, a lot of my co workers reaching out, making sure that I had, like, gone and gotten food and I was stocked up, and if I needed anything, if I wanted to come, stay or go anywhere, and just, like, complete strangers who hadn't really known me yet made me feel a lot more welcome in a city that I was new to.

I think when I was growing up in my teenage years, I did a lot of poetry performances, and in that way, I felt supported because people within that community, within Boston would come to our shows. We had. There was myself, others and myself who would go to different high schools and we perform or different talent shows or what have you, different youth conferences. And so the support amongst our peers, as well as a lot of adults who really believed in us, I think that was when I felt really supported by a community in Boston. You know, we will keep it moving. Thank you again, everyone. That's been awesome. All right, now that we've talked about times where you did feel supported, I want to leave room to talk about when that didn't happen. Could you tell us about what you worry about day to day? While living in Boston. Maybe this is related to health, finances, accessibility, inclusivity, or something else entirely. What kind of support do you wish you had for these worries?",

I feel like whenever I call the doctors, it's like months of a wait. And even though we have a lot of facilities here, I just think that it's. There's a lot of barriers to accessing both physical health and mental health care that I think is just tough. It's tough. And it feels like it exasperates the, like, financial worries and stress that you have because then you can't. It affects your health and you can't get help for that. And it's just a cycle. And so I think investments in some of our infrastructure would be really helpful. And yeah, more programs from the city to help. Because I do think, like, to Christelle's point, a lot of young people leave. You know, like, we get our. City. Of universities and they come here and get their degrees and then leave.

When you're kind of like moving upwards in your income. And then there's this place that you hit where you don't qualify for a lot of assistance, but you also don't make enough to kind of survive without that assistance. And that is the place that I'm at now. So I definitely think a lot about finances, especially with my kids. I just put my son in daycare and I don't get a voucher, so that's a thing. But also I worry a lot about. I think somebody touched on this of wanting to buy a house. Miliani said, wanting to buy a house, but I can't buy a house. I'm not going to be able to. I should believe in myself, but there's no way I'm going to be able to anytime soon. Buy a house in Roxbury or Dorchester, especially the area I live in. A lot of the buildings and the condos. Condos are like. Condos are like 500,000 houses are towards a million. And nobody's paying that. Not in Roxbury. I love Roxbury, but I'm not paying that in Roxbury. But, yes, that is where I'm at. And the kind of support I wish I had is. I wish. Honestly, I wish gentrification wasn't a thing because it pushes a lot of. I mean, it pushes all the prices up. But even. Especially when we think about those colleges and the influx of college students. And it kind of, in my opinion, from my experience, disrupts the housing market because people are more inclined to rent to people who are kind of breaking up the apartments into roommates, which is great. Everybody needs housing, but it creates. It can create some type of discrimination for folks who are from the community who need housing. So that, I think, has played a part in my own experience. And, yeah, we're going to move on. To wrap us up on a hopeful note, can we each try to imagine a Boston. This. I really like this question. Imagine a Boston community 10 years from now that is fully accessible and inclusive to you and people who look like you. Can you paint a picture of what that would feel like or look like for you? With that in mind, is there anything you wish Chica Project could provide in the future to make that a reality? I'm going to kick us off only because I think one of the things in 10 years I'm hoping there could be, when we're speaking about housing, if there could be some type of freeze on rental prices. And I think that could actually create options for people who are from the city, but also folks who are graduating from college as well. Because eventually we all have to make space for each other. And I think that will kind of help combine those worlds of a rental freeze. Because I, you know, somebody said not being able to, you get. I think, Christelle, you get the degree, but then you can't use that degree to pay for your. Your livelihood in the city. So there's some type of housing freeze where prices can kind of just stay where they're at without going too much higher. I think that could definitely help with the housing situation for folks. And I will pass it to. Since I mentioned Christel, I'm going to pass it to Crystal.",

Because I think most of us, we don't see ourselves retiring. Like, we're just gonna have to work and, you know, hopefully we don't die. But there's Nothing we can do because we're just not rich. I would, yeah, I would say definitely help for young adults. And in terms of healthcare, I do think Boston is lacking a lot with healthcare. Like, you'll call to book an appointment and they're like, we don't have anything until next year. And it's like, do you guys not have doctors? But that's another rant what I think Chica could help with maybe like someone in my shoes. And Miliani, who's also graduating next year. I'm sure job. Looking for a job is already stressful. So I would say having a career fair just so we could have like more of a network session from other companies. And I will pass it on to Miliani.",

But also like, I mean, I don't go to school in Chelsea anymore because I go to private school, but I used to go to charter and public school and a lot of the times it was like the teachers were like, from like Minnesota or like from other places.

Because anytime I would ever see anybody from where I'm from, it was like, if I'm going to market basket or like that. But I'll pass it off to Nicole.",

Yeah, I think when I think of Boston in 10 years, I definitely dream of a working tea and bus system so that more people can get around in and out, that we're not confined, accessibility wise. And. More housing, affordable housing for everyone, that there's a roof over everybody's head comfortably. And I think more of that community support, the community services where people are feeling like they can go somewhere to be seen, heard and valued. All of that would be super, super great. And wish she could provide in making that reality. I'd love for Chica to play. And. More housing, affordable housing for everyone, that there's a roof over everybody's head comfortably.

Like if people want to learn about advocacy and to get placements in, in government, in government offices and to get people in those rooms that they, they want to be in so that we have more diversity in those spaces and more representation from all of our communities.
