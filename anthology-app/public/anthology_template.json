      "speaker_text": "Okay, well, let's start at 6:22. Well, welcome. I'm glad you could come. This, this conversation is called Real Talk for Change. And we invited you to think about the pressing questions that you face and we all face, but really you face here in Boston. So our goal today is look at those questions and add your experience to probably now 300 other people who've had little conversations like this. We actually had 12 of these at Dorchester Bay. Elias was one of them. So I'm going to begin recording and I want to share a little information about why we're doing this. We're trying to create a new dialogue across the whole city of Boston so people can really listen to each other. A lot of times people don't listen as well as they talk, so we're going to mostly listen and also we want to have a different type of conversation. We're not going to ask you to make a speech or just tell us all the things that are wrong, but ask a question and tell us your personal lived experience. Your experience, not someone else or not we all or not what everybody thinks, but your personal experience, not, you know, what's your position on housing or this issue, but your experience. And we're doing this because I think when we talk about our personal experience, it builds more of a connection. And also when people in authority, whether they're in, whether it's the mayor or the governor or the head of a hospital, I think they're more likely to listen if they actually hear your voice. As opposed to. It's more personal. Yeah. You know, as opposed to reading something, they actually hear your voice because there's more emotion in our voice and my voice and your voice than there is just when you read something. So we're going to record this conversation and I just want to let you know what's going to happen. It, it's just an audio recording, no video obviously. And it's going to be part of this Real Talk for Change conversation. I don't know if you've seen the website. We have a website called Real Talk for Change dot org. Have you seen it, Kate? Yeah. Okay, cool. So it's hosted on this thing called lvn, which stands for Local Voices Network. And that's a web based tool that's used all over the country and they have a nonprofit that's called Cortico, I don't know what the name means. And there's a way in which after it's recorded, the system uploads certain key phrases, things you say and you can hear on the website, what people are actually saying. So this conversation, along with all the other conversations that have taken place and will take place, you know, from East Boston to Dorchester, Roxbury, all over the place, Hyde park, will be shared with others so you can hear what others are saying. Right now. You can go to realtalkforchange.org and listen to different conversations and hear real people, including some people from Dorchester Bay. So I've got to read the statement to ask you if you're willing to be recorded. Okay. It's more personal. Yeah. You know, as opposed to reading something, they actually hear your voice because there's more emotion in our voice and my voice and your voice than there is just when you read something. So we're going to record this conversation and I just want to let you know what's going to happen. It, it's just an audio recording, no video obviously.

So I've got to read the statement to ask you if you're willing to be recorded. Okay. Okay. So as a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Real Talk for change to use and retain the recording in accordance with its mission. You also understand that the conversation will be part of a protected collection on Cortico's Local Voices network, whose mission is to foster conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. Cortico will collect, retain and analyze these conversations in keeping with that mission. In addition, part of Real Talk's mission is to prevent present voices from the people of Boston. There, boy. Therefore, portions of your conversation can be made public. So if you understand and agree to this, just go around and say your name, and you can use a pseudonym, you know, a fake name if you want, and just say, my name is, you know, Sean. I agree.",

And the reason that is my question is because as a mother of two daughters and seeing all this guns, violence and missing kids around Boston, it makes me concerned. And my experience, like real experience has been like every day when my oldest daughter goes to school and the time that she returns, I feel like something's going to happen. I feel panic all the time. I have to be constant, like calling to see where she's at the moment, if she's on the bus, if she's walking. And now that is like kind of dark. It makes me feel like much more concerned and worried. She's 16. I still being like sometimes in the morning I have to bring her to the bus stop, like stay there, seeing that she's taking the public transportation. But on the time that she returns back, sometimes I'm at the work. I do not have that ass to. To be there, you know? And it makes me feel like we are not safe in here. And it's something that I question about it. When can we feel like peaceful, like they can walk in the street. Nothing's gonna happen. No one is gonna just take your kid. Oh no. No one is gonna get hurt because that's everywhere that you go around Boston specifically and Dorchester, you feel like it's not safe, you know? And that's my question. When we will feel safe in Boston? I want to see myself in the future, like because when I came here that Boston was my first place, especially Dorchester, because there's a community, Cape Verde community is in Dorchester. And it seen Dorchester as my room since I came, you know, And I would like to see and feel safe here and keep my kids here around Boston.",

There have been like, violent school even with the teachers. We had, like, recently school. That principal was beat up by a student.

I tell my kids, we're not from nowhere, but it started from there. So now it had built up to the point where we got the different gang of kids going to school and through the courts, you know, we. We lost respect from our kids. Because if I go to the school and smack the heck out of my kid, the teachers are mad at me, but how am I supposed to get control of the kid? Because the kid is being disrespectful to you, me, himself. It's crazy. So really, that's when I say we take a big jump. Because when it's my kids, I can go into school and say, what did you do? No, Mommy, Mommy, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Ms. Brown. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But now they cuss the parent out, the teacher out, the principal Fu. That's crazy.",

And when he got there, he. She came out and she's like, he's upstairs because he's talking to her, whispering, where is he? Where is he? You know, so he can know. So he goes up the stairs, he pulls out his gun, and he's like, listen, I'm gonna put you under arrest till I get to the story. He's like, no, you're not putting me under arrest. He's like, I have to put you under arrest, sir, until I get the story right now, you're being dangerous. So he jumps on my uncle and I fall down the stairs, and guess what she does? She start kicking and punching my uncle. That's why I said, call the police.",

But the cops refused to blame it on him and tried to put it on my boyfriend. My boyfriend's the one that found me. I bled for almost seven hours before I was found. So to put him through all that was wrong because he saved my life. But they tried to put it on him. So, you know, you laying in a hospital bed and they're trying to force a legion on you and everything else and, and trying to make you say that it was someone that it wasn't. It just doesn't make sense, you know? So it's hard to be honest when everybody's telling you not to be, you know? And the funny thing is, I don't lie about shit. I'm so honest. Even if it's like, Michelle, you should know that that's the way it is, you know? But yeah, I've always been an honest person. But they made me question that, you know, I'm okay, I'm 60 years old. He didn't kill me. He tried are. You know, he just took away my ability to have kids. That's all.",
