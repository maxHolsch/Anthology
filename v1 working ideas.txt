Please help me build the following: it should be a community story visualizer that we will call Anthology. 

Please see the related figma for information on it


Components:
- Comment rail (when you have multiple) https://www.figma.com/design/3RRAJtxVKX0kbSZT8ouJWa/Anthology-III?node-id=4-3760&t=JN4qdlt1xDfI1Af0-4

- visual map https://www.figma.com/design/3RRAJtxVKX0kbSZT8ouJWa/Anthology-III?node-id=4-3496&t=JN4qdlt1xDfI1Af0-4



distance logic?

Components of this website:
- Map
- Comment rail (are there more sub-components of the comment rail)



The map should work like the following:
- Question nodes should sit at the midpoint distance between all prompt nodes which are connected to it. These question nodes should be visible when you are very zoomed out, but not as you zoom deeper and deeper in. (i.e. once you zoom more than 25% in, they disappear)

- Excerpt nodes should be grey if not clicked on, and white if clicked on, like in this group. Please for now, have all of these nodes be circles https://www.figma.com/design/3RRAJtxVKX0kbSZT8ouJWa/Anthology-III?node-id=4-3496&t=JN4qdlt1xDfI1Af0-4 

- Prompt nodes should be marked as grey squares until clicked upon. if clicked upon should only display the text of the question in the comment rail


The comment rail should work something like the following:
- If you click on a single response node, it has a 1 node view, in which the comment rail is the text and info of the node, displayed in a beautiful manner, much like in this selection here https://www.figma.com/design/3RRAJtxVKX0kbSZT8ouJWa/Anthology-III?node-id=4-3280&t=JN4qdlt1xDfI1Af0-4

- If you click on a single question node, the comment rail should have a brief overview of each of the response nodes. https://www.figma.com/design/3RRAJtxVKX0kbSZT8ouJWa/Anthology-III?node-id=4-3428&t=JN4qdlt1xDfI1Af0-4


The comment rail should be a card that you can minimize and make big again


Multi-node view, in which the comment rail show an abridged version of the text (with a click for full text thing)





Data input pipeline
Original data you take in: a json file that may have different configurations. Sometimes it will just be a .txt file
Please call an LLM to convert it into the json format we want,



Data Structures:
- Excerpt nodes: are either type prompt or response. it points to a node, the field is titled "responds to". It has a name of speaker, and speaker text. It also has Audio start, and audio end, which are timestamp variables

- Question nodes: Have a series of pointers to related prompts, as well as question text
