let's say I open the website. What will be the first thing that I see? Describe me it

Let's say I start zooming in with my mouse, what happens?

let's say I click and drag over to another area, what happens? is click and drag availible?

if I click on a question, what happens to my zoom? what happens to my comment rail?


what is the font and style of this anthology?

How does the logic for the pause and play audio button work?


we should resolve the toolkit used, and do a good job of getting that toolkit together

is a question node related to one audio file?

is playlist generation the same as conversation play?

have it first get a sense of the design + components, then build things in line with them

medeley for questions, none for prompts


> for question 1, how would using force-directed graphs cause this to play out? Would the question not be generally close to the cluster of prompt nodes attached to
  it? WHen I say midpoint, it should be the average midpoint if that makes sense.

  you make a good point about the questions, maybe they should just remain the same size as text on your screen, so the nodes become more and more visible, (and
  some questions on the side are no longer visible as you zoom in on one part of the screen), but the question you zoom in on remains

  good question about our audio, and it highlights an important thing that we should change in our documentation. Audio playlists should only play when you click on
  a question, not on a prompt. In fact, when you click on a prompt node, you should not see the text of the question at all. All you see on the comment rail side
  is the multi-node view, where the selected nodes are the ones which connect to the question node. When you click on the question, the audio playlist button should
  do the following. If clicked, it will highlight one response node it is connected to (question->prompt node->response node), and play it through before going to
  the next node. All the while, the prompt nodes should be visible on the comment rail on the side 



   4. Multi-Node Selection Limits

  - Line 77: "unlimited capacity" for multi-node view
  - Question: This could cause performance issues with hundreds of nodes. Should there be a practical limit or virtualization strategy mentioned?

  5. Response Node Grouping

  - Line 84: "Clicking a prompt node: Selects all response nodes"
  - Question: What if a prompt has 50+ responses? Does this flood the comment rail? How does the UI handle extreme cases?

  6. Audio Timestamp Gaps

  - Line 162: "Graceful handling of gaps between segments"
  - Question: What does "graceful" mean specifically? Skip silence? Insert pause? Play ambient sound? This needs concrete behavior definition.

  7. Data Processing with LLM

  - Lines 200-203: "Utilize LLM for intelligent parsing"
  - Question: This is vague - what specific parsing is the LLM doing? How does it handle ambiguous or malformed input? What are the fallback strategies if LLM
  parsing fails?

  8. Force-Directed Graph Parameters

  - Line 328: "Force-directed graph algorithm for organic positioning"
  - Question: What are the specific force parameters? How do you prevent node overlap? What about stability - do nodes keep moving or settle?

  9. Comment Rail Width

  - Line 335: "Fixed right sidebar (30% width)"
  - Question: This might be too rigid for different screen sizes. What about mobile? Should this be responsive or have breakpoints?

  10. Zoom Level Dependencies

  - Throughout: Multiple features depend on zoom levels
  - Question: How are zoom levels measured/defined? Is 25% relative to what baseline? Viewport? Original size?

⏺ 💡 Suggestions for Clarity

  1. Define concrete zoom level measurements (pixels, percentage of viewport, etc.)
  2. Specify audio gap handling behavior explicitly
  3. Add performance boundaries for multi-node selection
  4. Clarify the question node audio behavior contradiction
  5. Detail the LLM parsing requirements and error handling
  6. Consider responsive design for the comment rail width
  7. Define force-directed graph parameters to prevent chaotic movement
